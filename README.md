# GUEye - Natural UI for Personal Computers

A hobby project built in one evening for **Project Presentation: Prototype** in BITS Pilani's techfest - [APOGEE](http://bits-apogee.org/). This project makes use of  Edwin Dalmaijer's excellent ```webcam-eyetracker```
[software](https://github.com/esdalmaijer/webcam-eyetracker) in addition to mechanization using Selenium and AutoPy to provide a hands-free Natural User Interface for the popular operating systems which support Python. This has been tested to work on Arch Linux and Ubuntu 14.10.
